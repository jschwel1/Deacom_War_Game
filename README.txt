Program: War
Written By: Jacob Schwell

This program implements a simulation of the game war either by automatically iterating through all combinations or by going through each round sequentially.

Game rules:
Both players start with half of the shuffled 52-card deck. Each round, both players flip their top card and whoever has the higher value keeps both cards. In the case of a tie, three cards from each hand are placed face down and a fourth one determines the winner. Wars can stack until a clear winner is determined who collects all the cards on the table. Once cards are won, they are placed on the bottom of a player's deck to be used again. A player wins when he or she holds all the cards.
